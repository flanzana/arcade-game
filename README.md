## Introduction
Classic Arcade game has been made as a project for Udacity nanodegree Front-End Web Developer.

## Instructions how to play a game
- Open the file [index.html](index.html) in your browser (Google Chrome is recommended) and start the game.
- The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
- The player can move left, right, up and down.
- When colliding into the enemy, player loses one life. When player loses all three lives, the game is over.
- When the player reaches water, it get returned back to initial position. When player reaches water 10 times, player wins the game.

## How to build a game
Students wonâ€™t have to build the game from scratch. Udacity has provided the art assets and game engine for student. Make sure the functions student writes are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within the class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.
